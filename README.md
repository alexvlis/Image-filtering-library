# image-filtering-library
This library includes a set of image de-noising and enhancing filters
This project explores the use of linear, non-linear and morphological filters on various images. These filters can be used to remove impulsive noise from images to prepare them for edge detection and feature extraction. This report focuses on two images, one ultasound image of a foetus, and a SAR image of New Zealand. The functions described in this report assume double images as inputs, in order to make use of MATLABâ€™s statistics functions. Please read report.pdf for more details.
